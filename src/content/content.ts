  summary: dedent`
    I'm a frontend developer with over 6 years of experience and a good grasp of backend work. My background covers web, cross-platform mobile, and fullstack projects - mostly with TypeScript, React, and Node.js. I've built everything from complex web apps to internal tools, and I'm comfortable working with CI/CD, Docker, and AWS S3. If needed, I can take a feature from idea to production, including backend and database work.
  
    I don't afraid of getting out from my comfort zone and learning new things, enjoy solving complex problems, and always aim to deliver work I'm proud of.
